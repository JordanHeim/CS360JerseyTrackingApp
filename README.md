# CS360JerseyTrackingApp

# Requirements
I was tasked with developing an inventory app. I needed to create a login screen, a register screen, a screen to view the inventory, a screen to add inventory, 
and a screen to edit inventory. I also need to be able to delete various items and keep a databse of users and items for my app. The inventory app I created 
was cetnered around jerseys and keeping track of the various jerseys someone might have. The various fields for the jerseys included the jersey name, jersey type, 
and jersey quantity. I included the various features to show a view of the jerseys, add a jersey, edit an exitsing jersey, and delete and exitsing jersey. 
The app was designed to be simple and easy to use. The various components on the screen are minimal and there are messages to help the user understand what they
are acccomplishing. 

# The Process
I started by creating design mockups of my app making sure that I included all of the necessary components and having a breif understanding of how I would need to 
implement the functionality within the various UI screens. I then began coding the functionality for the databases, and then the screens. I made sure to 
include the necessary components for each widget and field that was included in my UI. I also made sure to test as often as I could. I wanted to make sure 
to resolve any bugs that I encountered as early as I could, so that it would not spiral into a a bigger problem. After my coding was completed, I made sure to 
test my app as if I was the user. I wanted to make sure that I could use the app the way it was intended. this was a great method to make sure that any bugs
I ran into would be solved right away. 

# Roadblocks
I encounted a large roadblock when it came time to code the app. I had designed a UI that I like and thought would be easy to create the functionality part. 
I ran into trouble creating the functionality and decided to start from scratch. I kept a lot of my designs, but limited the amount of movement and XML files 
associated with my app. There were also various requrirements I was not able to include in my project due to time restraints. I now know for the future that 
I should plan ahead and work early to allow myself enough time to include all of the necessary requirements and fix any errors I encounter. 

# Success
I was very successful in the design part of my app. I was very happy with the way the app looked and felt after development. I would have liked to included 
more components and seen how that would have affected the feel of my app, but was happy with what I was able to get done. I gained a lot of useful skills from 
this project such as learning Android Development practices, working with multiple files and linking them all together, interpreting requirements and
implementing them into the development process, and learning the best practices when developing a mobile app.
