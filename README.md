# CS360JerseyTrackingApp

# Summary
This school project was to create an Android Inventory App of your choice. I chose a Jersey Tracking app that consisted of several screens including login, register, inventory view, add inventory, and edit inventory. The project had several requirements and most of them were met with success. 

*Please note that some sections of the code were written and given by Southern New Hampshire University, and they are the sole owners of it.
